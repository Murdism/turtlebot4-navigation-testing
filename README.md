## üìä Performance Metrics & Data Collection Strategy

### Why We Track Planned vs Actual Paths

**Planned Path (`/plan` topic)**:
- **Source**: Nav2 global planner output showing the intended navigation route
- **Purpose**: Represents optimal path computation considering obstacles and map constraints
- **Analysis Value**: Reveals planning algorithm quality, path smoothness, and obstacle avoidance strategy

**Actual Path (`/amcl_pose` topic)**:  
- **Source**: AMCL localization estimates showing where the robot believes it traveled
- **Purpose**: Captures real-world navigation performance including localization uncertainty
- **Analysis Value**: Reflects actual system behavior, control accuracy, and localization quality

This dual-path approach enables detection of both **planning issues** (suboptimal routes) and **execution issues** (poor path following), making it the industry standard for Nav2 performance evaluation.

### Critical Role of Test Repetitions

**Statistical Confidence**: Single test runs can be misleading due to:
- Localization noise and uncertainty
- Dynamic obstacle interactions  
- Stochastic planning algorithms
- Sensor noise and environmental variations

**Use Cases Requiring Repetitions**:
- **Regression Testing**: Ensure navigation performance doesn't degrade after code changes
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare different navigation configurations statistically  
- **Reliability Assessment**: Measure success rates under various conditions
- **Algorithm Validation**: Validate new planners/controllers with statistical significance

### Comprehensive Performance Metrics

#### Navigation Success Metrics
- **Test Status**: PASS/FAIL validation based on goal achievement within distance threshold
- **Nav2 Status**: Detailed navigation stack result codes (SUCCEEDED, ABORTED, CANCELED, etc.)
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of successful completions across multiple runs (critical for reliability)
- **Recovery Behaviors**: Count of recovery attempts indicating navigation difficulty

#### Timing & Performance Analysis  
- **Navigation Duration**: Total time from goal submission to completion
- **Statistical Analysis**: Mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation across repetitions
- **Timeout Detection**: Identification of navigation failures due to time limits

#### Path Quality & Efficiency Metrics
- **Path Efficiency**: Ratio of optimal (straight-line) distance to actual path length
- **Path Deviation**: Average distance between planned and actual trajectory points
- **Path Length Analysis**: Comparison of planned vs actual distances traveled
- **Trajectory Smoothness**: Assessment of path following accuracy and control quality

#### Advanced Analysis
- **Path Interpolation Matching**: For each planned waypoint, finds closest actual pose for precise deviation calculation
- **Multi-Run Deviation Averaging**: Statistical path analysis across all successful test iterations
- **Reference Path Extraction**: Captures complete planned and actual trajectories for visualization

## üìà Test Reports & Visualization Data

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Container won't start with GUI:**
```bash
# Ensure X11 forwarding is working
xhost +local:docker
```

**Gazebo/RViz loading issues:**
```bash
# Close all instances and restart container
# Sometimes takes 30s-1min to fully load - be patient
```

**Robot teleportation fails:**
```bash
# Check Gazebo service availability
gz service -l | grep set_pose
```

**Navigation timeout:**
```bash
# Increase distance threshold for complex environments
# Verify goal position is reachable in RViz
```

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Monitor navigation progress
ros2 topic echo /navigate_to_pose/_action/feedback

# Check robot localization
ros2 topic echo /amcl_pose

# View planned path
ros2 topic echo /plan
```

## üî¨ Technical Implementation & Use Cases

### Data Collection Strategy

**Industry-Standard Approach**: 
- **Reference Path**: `/plan` topic captures Nav2 global planner intentions
- **Robot Path**: `/amcl_pose` topic tracks actual localization-based movement
- **Real-time Metrics**: Nav2 action feedback provides duration, recoveries, and completion status

### Primary Use Cases

**üîÑ Continuous Integration Testing**:
- Automated regression testing after navigation stack updates
- Statistical validation with 10+ repetitions for reliable CI/CD pipelines

**‚ö° Performance Benchmarking**:
- Compare different planner configurations (DWB, TEB, etc.)
- Evaluate navigation performance across various environment complexities

**üéØ Algorithm Validation**:
- Validate new navigation algorithms with statistical significance
- A/B testing of navigation parameter tunings

**üè≠ Production Readiness Assessment**:
- Reliability testing with hundreds of repetitions
- Success rate validation for deployment decisions

### Auto-World Detection
